For this project, I replaced non-sematic elements of Horiseon's webpage with sematic elements (including header, sections, and footer).
In addition to this, I 'cleaned up' the CSS by eliminating all repeat code (essentially changing it from 'WET' to 'DRY').
The website looks and functions the same as before, however the code is now refactored into a more organized and digestable arrangment.
